## Job Board

- **Name**: [e.g., Glassdoor]
- **URL**: [e.g., https://glassdoor.com.au]
- **Region**: [Australia-wide / State-specific]

## Why Add This?

How many listings does this board have? Does it cover a gap in existing scrapers?

## Technical Approach

- [ ] Simple HTTP scraping (requests + BeautifulSoup)
- [ ] API (public or GraphQL)
- [ ] Browser automation required (nodriver/Playwright)
- [ ] Existing library available (e.g., JobSpy)

## Anti-Scraping Measures

Does the site use CAPTCHAs, rate limiting, or bot detection? How will you handle it?

## Sample Listings

Link to a few example job listings from this board.

## Willing to Implement?

- [ ] Yes, I can submit a PR
- [ ] No, just suggesting the idea
