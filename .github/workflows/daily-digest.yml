# Daily Digest (Web Subscriptions) — runs in YOUR private fork, not on the public repo.
#
# This workflow triggers the web app's cron endpoint to process
# all active email subscriptions created through the web UI.
#
# Setup (one-time):
#   1. Fork this repo and deploy the web app to Vercel
#   2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
#   3. Add these secrets:
#      - APP_URL     → Your Vercel app URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)
#      - CRON_SECRET → A random string (must match CRON_SECRET in your Vercel env)
#   4. Go to Actions → "Daily Digest" → Enable workflow
#   5. Click "Run workflow" for your first manual run
#   6. To enable daily automation, uncomment the schedule block below
