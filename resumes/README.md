# Resumes

Place your resume files here. The scraper uses these for AI-powered job matching.

## Supported Formats

- **PDF** — Upload via the web app, or place here for CLI mode
- **LaTeX** — If you use LaTeX, place your `.tex` source and build artifacts here

## CLI Mode

The CLI scraper (`scrape.py`) looks for resume files in this directory. Place your PDF resume here and it will be parsed automatically.

## Web App Mode

Upload your PDF through the web interface at `/` — no need to place files here manually.

## Privacy

Resume files are gitignored and will never be committed to the repository.
